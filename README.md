# Election-Analysis

##Overview of Election Audit 
My job was to help Seth and Tom submit the election audit results to the election commission. Additionally, the election commission requested addiitonal information.

1.The voter turnout for each county.

2.The perecentage of votes from each county out of the total count.

3.The county with the highest turnout.

##Resources
-Data Source:election_results.csv
-Software: Python 3.6.1, Visual Code, 1.38.1

###Election Audit results 

Our findings show that there were a total of 369,711 votes. There were three counties that participated: Jefferson, Denver, and Arapahoe.
-Jefferson had 10.5% of the votes which were 38,855.
-Denver had 82.8% of the votes which were 306,055.
-Arapahoe had 6.7% of the votes which were 24,801.
We also found out that the largest County Turnout was Denver.
The canddidates votes were:
-Charles Casper Stockham received 85,213 votes or 23%
-Diana DeGetter received 272,892 votes or 73.8%
-Raymon Anthony Doane received 11,606 votes or 3.1% 


 As our data above shows, our winner candidate was Diana DeGette with 272,892 of the votes which was 73.8% from the total votes.

##Challenge Overview
Overall we had three counties which we were responsible to get voting data from. We had the results of the vote count in the form of excel. We usued Visual Studio Code and Python to write codes to get our information in a cleaner form. 

##Challenge Summary 
This election's winner had a large margin over the other two candidates. If this script was to be used for other elections it could have a bigger data set which would give us more candidates; therefore, more data to analyze. Additionally, we can add additional stats about different voting methods such as mail in votes, early voting and same day votes. we could separate them and see where we can approve the accesibility to voting depending on which method was used.
